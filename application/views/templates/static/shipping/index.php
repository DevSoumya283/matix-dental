                <p>MATIXdental&rsquo;s third-party shipping policies are set by the sellers that use our site (either on the marketplace, or on their own sites powered by MATIXdental e-commerce platform). </p>

                <p>The typical policy for products sold by MATIXdental partners will offer free 2-5 day shipping on orders over $49. Items shipping as freight may take longer than 5 days to arrive.</p>

                <p>To qualify for free shipping, your order of merchandise total before savings and estimated tax needs to be at least $49. You can&rsquo;t combine multiple orders to reach that number. Small orders are more expensive to fulfill, so you&rsquo;ll have to typically pay a $5.99 shipping charge on orders under $49 &mdash; which means that ordering more at once will definitely get you better value.</p>

                <p>To make sure we can get items marked with 2-day delivery to you in two business days, you need to place your order by 2 PM EST.</p>

                <p>We can&rsquo;t control delays caused by carriers, information errors, changes to orders, holidays or bad weather. </p>

                <h4>Do all orders qualify for free shipping?</h4>

                <p>To qualify for free shipping, your order merchandise total before estimated tax needs to be at least $49. You can&rsquo;t combine multiple orders to reach that number. Orders below $49 are typically charged a fixed shipping fee of $5.99.</p>

                <h4>Where does MATIXdental Vendors ship?</h4>

                <p>This shipping policy extends to the 48 contiguous U.S. states and the District of Columbia. If you&rsquo;re in Alaska or Hawaii, shipping pricing may differ.</p>

                <h4>Where do my MATIXdental packages ship from?</h4>

                <p>MATIXdental orders are delivered from the warehouses of our retail partners. MATIXdental allows you to select retailers that can fulfill your shipment in the most efficient, cost-effective way.</p>

                <p>Your order may occasionally be fulfilled by a retailer other than the one stated at checkout, but you will always pay the same price.</p>

                <h3>Returns</h3>

                <h4>How do I return an item?</h4>

                <p>You can initiate a return by visiting the <a href="https://jet.com/account/orders">Order History</a> section in your MATIXdental account. There, you&rsquo;ll be able to see the previous order and initiate a return. You must contact the vendor directly for return process initiation. Once accepted by the vendor action must be taken to return the item. When the vendor receives the returned item, your payment method will be return credited. Don&rsquo;t forget, the item has to be sent back in its original condition (with the original packaging) within 30 days. The amount you will be refunded is the price minus the savings you received on the item, plus any taxes you paid on the item. It may take 10-14 business days after the receipt of your returned items to process your refund.</p>

                <h4>Are any products non-returnable?</h4>

                <p>Yes. There are some items that cannot be returned as directed by the FDA. These items are identified as &lsquo;non-returnable&rsquo; on their individual product pages. MATIXdental also reserves the right to refuse your return if we receive the returned item outside our 30 day return window or if the item returned is not in its original condition (opened, damaged, or not in its original packaging).</p>

                <h4>What if I am having issues returning an item that was sent to me from a MATIXdental retailer?</h4>

                <p>You can either visit your <a href="https://jet.com/account/orders">Order History</a> to initiate a return, contact the vendor directly, or contact us by email at <a href="mailto:admin@MATIXdental.com">admin@MATIXdental.com</a> and we will help facilitate a return.</p>
