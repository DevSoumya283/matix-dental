            <h3>How do I return an item?</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12 col-xs-12">
                    <p>You can initiate a return by visiting the <a class="link" href="<?php echo base_url('history'); ?>">Order History</a> section in your MATIXdental account. There, you’ll be able to see the previous order and initiate a return. Once accepted by the vendor action must be taken to return the item.</p>
                    <p>When the vendor receives the returned item, your payment method will be return credited. Don’t forget, the item has to be sent back in its original condition (with the original packaging) within 30 days.</p>
                    <p>The amount you will be refunded is the price minus the savings you received on the item, plus any taxes you paid on the item.</p>
                It may take 10-14 business days after the receipt of your returned items to process your refund. MATIXdental takes care of all the details of a return to us or to any of our retailer partners for you.</p>
                <p>You can either visit your <a class="link" href="<?php echo base_url('history'); ?>">Order History</a> to initiate a return, contact the vendor directly, or contact us by email at admin@MATIXdental.com and we will help facilitate a return.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Are any products non-returnable?</h3>
                <p>Yes. There are some items that cannot be returned as directed by the FDA. These items are identified as ‘non-returnable’ on their individual product pages.</p>
                <p>MATIXdental also reserves the right to refuse your return if we receive the returned item outside our 30 day return window or if the item returned is not in its original condition (opened, damaged, or not in its original packaging).</p>
