                </ul>
                <p>When you interact with MATIXdental using an external social network (for example, your Facebook account), we may collect your name and other details from your social network profile and account. Please note that when interacting with MATIXdental from a third party social network, in addition to our Terms of Use and Privacy Notice, you are bound by the terms of use and privacy policies of those websites.</p>
                <h4>Information We Collect by Automated Means</h4>
                <p>When you use MATIXdental, we and third parties may collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, Web server logs, Web beacons, JavaScript, and components of our apps. We may tie this information to personal information about you that we collect from other sources or that you provide to us.</p>
                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <p>Cookies are files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings on your device. Without cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features of MATIXdental.</p>
                <p>MATIXdental may use HTTP cookies, HTML5 cookies, Flash cookies, and other types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage). Your browser may allow you to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies. You also may be able to delete your Flash cookies or adjust your Flash cookie settings by visiting the Adobe Flash Website Storage Settings Manager by following Adobe's instructions <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">here</a> (instruction vary depending on your operating system and version of Flash).</p>
                <h4>Web server logs and Web Beacons</h4>
                <p>Web server logs may collect information about your device, operating system, browser, domain, and other system settings, such as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located; the address of the Web page that referred you to MATIXdental; the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet; and other information about your interaction with MATIXdental, such as which pages you visit. To control which Web servers collect information by automated means, we may place small electronic tags called Web beacons on our Web pages and in our emails, which are files that link Web pages to particular Web servers and their cookies. Again, without web server logs and web beacons, you may not be able to use all of the features of MATIXdental.</p>
                <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                <p>We or third parties also may send instructions to your device using JavaScript or other computer languages to store or gather the sorts of information described above and other details about your interactions with MATIXdental.</p>
                <h4>Mobile Applications, Device Identifiers and SDKs.</h4>
                <p>When you install a mobile app that we provide, we may use or work with partners and service providers who use mobile &ldquo;SDKs&rdquo; or similar code, in order to collect information such as device identifiers, mobile advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), IP addresses, Internet connection information, as well as details about your device (such as device type), mobile browser or operating system, or about how you interact with our apps or services. A mobile SDK is in effect the mobile app version of a pixel tag or beacon. The SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented. We may use this technology, for instance, to analyze how our customers use our applications and make purchase, or to deliver or measure certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device. These SDKs (or other, similar mobile applications and code) may collect mobile identifiers or geolocation information, which may be precise, GPS-level information. If you would like to opt out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please go to the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; on your mobile device for directions on how to do so.</p>
                <h4>How We Use Your Information</h4>

                <p>In addition, if you sign up for an account by clicking on an affiliate or referral link (e.g., on a social media site or elsewhere online) served by someone who has identified you as a contact of theirs, we may share your personal information with that contact.

                <p>Third parties may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use MATIXdental.

Such providers&rsquo; use of the information is subject to their own privacy policies, which we recommend you review. We are not responsible for such providers&rsquo; privacy practices, and those practices are not covered by this Privacy Notice.</p>

                <h4>Information Security</h4>
                <p>We take many steps to protect your information, but we can&rsquo;t promise that our security program will eliminate all security risks. When you provide information to us, you do so at your own risk.</p>
                <p>But we do ask you to please help protect your information. There are a number of things you can do, such as:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Using a unique password for MATIXdental that never has or will be used anywhere else - please think up a new one that you never used before, and please only use that password with us;</li>
                    <li> Protecting the confidentiality of your login information - don&rsquo;t give your username or password to anyone, anywhere, anytime;</li>
                    <li> Accessing MATIXdental only from devices that have an up-to-date operating system and up-to-date security software (this makes MATIXdental work better anyway); and</li>
                    <li> Notifying us of any suspected unauthorized activity by emailing us at privacy@MATIXdental.com.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Taking these steps will not guarantee security but may help lower the risk or impact of certain security threats. For further information about protecting your security, visit <a href="http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/computer-security">computer-security</a>.
